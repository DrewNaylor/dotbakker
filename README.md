# dotbakker
Copies files and adds the ".bak#" extension, where "#" is the lowest number in the folder that doesn't exist yet. I'd advise against using this on large files as it's not async and doesn't display progress.

Visual Studio 2019 Community is being used for this project, and you'll need .NET Framework 4.8 to run the GUI. The CLI isn't ready yet, but I'd like to have it be a cross-platform version that the GUI ends up using. It'll use the latest version of .NET when it's ready, whichever version is the latest when I get around to it.
