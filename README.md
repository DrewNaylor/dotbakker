# dotbakker
Copies files and adds the ".bak#" extension, where "#" is the highest number in the folder that doesn't exist yet.

Visual Studio 2019 Community is being used for this project, and you'll need .NET Framework 4.8 to run the GUI. The CLI isn't ready yet, but I'd like to have it be a cross-platform version that the GUI ends up using. It'll use .NET 5 when it's ready.
